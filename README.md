## Malware OWL

The Malware ontology project is meant to help in identifiyng similarities between malware files. Based on in-depth analysis from multiple sources, a complete characterization of the file is made and based on it different conclusions can be taken and meta informations can be constructed.

### Challenges

Because new properties on files may be found in any moment, and also for a more scalable project, the ontology needs to be easily editable instantly, with new triples being inserted in it when new vocabulary names or new file properties are found.

As long as they point to common concepts simmilarities can be found between any two files. Therefore a limit must be set on the number of edges between two files. Also, adding a second limit based on percentage (calculated on multiple properties common to the 2 files) increases the effectiveness of the application.

The client for the application will use API endpoints to get the needed file properties, values and simmilarities. The API needs to transform requests into valid SPARQL interogations and then interpretate and convert the response.
