			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>The Malware ontology project is meant to help in identifiyng similarities between malware files. Based on in-depth analysis from multiple sources, a complete characterization of the file is made and based on it different conclusions can be taken and meta informations can be constructed.</p>
		</section>
		<section typeof="sa:MaterialsAndMethods">
			<h2>Materials And Methods</h2>
			<p>Using a few online api's and tools (VirusTotal, malwr.com, MalwareViz, Mastiff) as many properties as possible are processed about the file, each of them being connected in the malware ontology. New porperties can be inserted dinamically in the ontology.</p>
			<p>A custom ontology is constructed for the project, using certain vocabulary elements from dbpedia, schema.org to define known concepts, the authors are defining a malware vocabulary that works in unison with the results from the file analysis.</p>
			<p>Based on this huge database of triples many simmilarities can be found between different files at more then one scope of view.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<section>
				<h3>Mapping the ontology dinamically</h3>
				<p>Because new properties on files may be found in any moment, and also for a more scalable project, the ontology needs to be easily editable instantly, with new triples being inserted in it when new vocabulary names or new file properties are found.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Separating the simmilarities</h3>
				<p>As long as they point to common concepts simmilarities can be found between any two files. Therefore a limit must be set on the number of edges between two files. Also, adding a second limit based on percentage (calculated on multiple properties common to the 2 files) increases the effectiveness of the application.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Providing an API</h3>
				<p>The client for the application will use API endpoints to get the needed file properties, values and simmilarities. The API needs to transform requests into valid SPARQL interogations and then interpretate and convert the response.</p>
			</section>
			
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Client Side application</h2>
			<p>On the client side, the application needs to be able to send requests on the file and present the results by constructing a visual graph. The different scopes are treated with the scrooling functionality. When a user goes witht he mouse on a section and scrools in, that section expands taking over the screeen and displaying more information about it. This can be seen in the representation of the leveled scopes below.</p>

		<section typeof="sa:Conclusion">
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Through an ontology the connections between infected files are explored in depth, this provides valuable help and insight for malware analysis speeding up the process and finding new connections between previously unknown malwares.</p>
